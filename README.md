Electric Vehicle (EV) Analysis - Power BI
Project Overview
This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the electric vehicle (EV) market in India, with a focus on 2-wheelers and 4-wheelers. The analysis leverages Power BI to visualize key metrics related to EV sales, growth trends, market penetration, and other critical factors in the EV industry.
The key focus areas of the analysis include:
Sales performance of EV makers across different fiscal years.
EV penetration in various states in India.
Quarterly trends for EV sales.
Growth rates and projections for the EV market.
Impact of government incentives on EV adoption.
Recommendations for EV market strategies.
